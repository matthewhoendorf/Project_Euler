# Project_Euler
Project Euler problems implemented in Python.

Bored with work and school, I decided to implement the solutions to these problems in my free time.

I hope to gain a deeper understanding of Python and to improve my mathematical problem solving skills.

Note that some solutions will allow entry of variables so that functions can be used to solve for many cases, not just the one defined in the problem.
